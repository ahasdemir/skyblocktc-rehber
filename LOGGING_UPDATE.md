- Proper error handling for invalid/missing tokens

## 🎨 Discord Webhook Enhancements

- **Role-based colors and emojis:**

  - More detailed user information
  - Better organized fields
  - Consistent branding with "SkyBlockTC MongoDB Auth System"
  - Truncated session IDs for security (first 12 characters)

## 🧪 Testing Tools

- **Discord Webhook Test Endpoint**: `/api/test-discord-webhook`
  - GET: Check webhook configuration status
  - POST: Send test message to Discord webhook
  - Detailed error logging for debugging

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The logging system is now fully integrated with the MongoDB authentication system and ready for production use. All Discord webhook notifications will now include proper user authentication and enhanced formatting.

### Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env.local` file includes:
```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your-discord-webhook-url
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
```

### Testing the Discord Webhook

You can test your Discord webhook by sending a POST request to:
```
POST /api/test-discord-webhook
```

### Next Steps (Optional)

1. Test the Discord webhook using the test endpoint
2. Verify logout functionality works correctly
3. Monitor all logging endpoints in production
4. Consider adding rate limiting for log endpoints
5. Add logging for other admin actions if needed
